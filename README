Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis, a Hungarian physician born in 1818 and active at the Vienna General Hospital.
Childbed fever: A deadly disease affecting women that just have given birth. 
He is thinking about it because in the early 1840s at the Vienna General Hospital as many as 10% of the women giving birth die from it. 
He is thinking about it because he knows the cause of childbed fever: It's the contaminated hands of the doctors delivering the babies.
And they won't listen to him and wash their hands

In this project, we're going to reanalyze the data that made Semmelweis discover the importance of handwashing. We will compare data from two clinics to show the effect of handwashing.
Then we would compare the data before and after the start of handwashing. To test the statistical significance of results, we will perform bootstrap analysis to determine the values with
95% confidence interval.
