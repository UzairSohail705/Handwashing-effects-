Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis was a Hungarian physician born in 1818 and active at the Vienna General Hospital. There was a massive issue of a disease
named Childbed fever which affected women that just have given birth. As many as 10% of the women giving birth die from it. The doctor's hypothesis
is that there is something contaminated with the hands of doctors delivering the babies. But they don't listen to him and wash hands since
bacteria wasn't known back then. 

In this project, we're going to analyze the data that made Semmelweis discover the importance of handwashing. We will compare data from two
clinics to show the effect of handwashing. as they had a significant difference in the proportion of deaths. Then we would compare the data
before and after the start of handwashing. To test the statistical significance of results, we will perform bootstrap analysis to determine
the values with 95% confidence interval.

Upon analysis, I found that handwashing did lower the proportion of deaths. The deaths were lowered between 6.2% and 10% with a 95% confidence
interval. Here are few of the tools/methods/commands that were used to complete this project:

-Libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib
-Statistical analysis: Bootstrap analysis (in which we resample the data to test for statistical significance)
-Commands/Methods: .loc, .append, .plot, .to_datetime, .mean, .series, .sample
